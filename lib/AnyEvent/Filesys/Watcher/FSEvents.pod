=head1 NAME

AnyEvent::Filesys::Watcher::FSEvents - MacOS file system watcher

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $watcher = AnyEvent::Filesys::Watcher::FSEvents->new(
		directories => ['lib', 't'],
		callback => sub { warn "you're working too much"},
    );

    # This has the same effect as:

    $watcher = AnyEvent::Filesys::Watcher->new(
        backend => 'FSEvents',
        directories => ['lib', 't'],
        callback => sub { warn "you're working too much"},
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the Mac OS backend for L<AnyEvent::Filesys::Watcher>.  It uses
L<Mac::FSEvents> as the underlying implementation.

=head1 INSTALLATION

At the time of this writing, the version on CPAN is 0.14 and will most likely
fail to build.  It fails with "Could not parse version string!".

If you run into this problem, try to use the
L<fork|https://github.com/skaji/Mac-FSEvents> instead. See
L<https://github.com/glohr/AnyEvent-Filesys-Watcher/#installation> for more
information.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

You should normally call the
L<constructor of the base class|AnyEvent::Filesys::Watch/"CONSTRUCTOR"> that
will pick the optimal backend for the current platform.

The following constructors are available:

=over 4

=item B<new(OPTIONS)>

Creates a new B<AnyEvent::Filesys::Watcher>.  The constructor may throw an
exception in case of an error!

B<OPTIONS> is a hash of named options:

=over 8

=item B<directories DIRECTORIES>

B<DIRECTORIES> is a reference to an array of directories to monitor. A single
directory can also be passed as a scalar.

This argument is required.

=item B<callback CALLBACK>

A code reference that is called, when a modification to the monitored
directories is deteced. The callback is passed a list of
L<AnyEvent::Filesys::Watcher::Events>.

This argument is required.

=item B<cb CALLBACK>

This is an alias for the parameter B<callback>.

This argument is required if the argument B<callback> has not been given.

=item B<interval SECONDS>

Specifies the time in fractional seconds between file system checks.

Optional. The default is 2.0.

=item B<filter FILTER>

B<FILTER> should either be a regular expression or a code reference.  If this
is a regular expression, only (absolute) file names matching that regular
expressions can cause an event.

If B<FILTER> is a code reference, the subrouting receives the absolute file
name as an argument and should return a truthy value for all files that
should cause an event.

Optional. By default, all events are passed through.

=item <skip_subdirectories BOOLEAN>

Skips subdirectories and anything in them while building a list of
files/dirs to watch. Optional.

=back

All other options are ignored.
