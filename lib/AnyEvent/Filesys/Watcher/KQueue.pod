=head1 NAME

AnyEvent::Filesys::Watcher::KQueue - BSD file system watcher

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $watcher = AnyEvent::Filesys::Watcher::KQueue->new(
		directories => ['lib', 't'],
		callback => sub { warn "you're working too much"},
    );

    # This has the same effect as:

    $watcher = AnyEvent::Filesys::Watcher->new(
        backend => 'KQueue',
        directories => ['lib', 't'],
        callback => sub { warn "you're working too much"},
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the BSD backend for L<AnyEvent::Filesys::Watcher>.  It uses
L<IO::KQueue> as the underlying implementation.  It also works on Mac OS but
you have little reason to prefer it over
L<AnyEvent::Filesys::Watcher::FSEvents> because of its limitations.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

You should normally call the
L<constructor of the base class|AnyEvent::Filesys::Watch/"CONSTRUCTOR"> that
will pick the optimal backend for the current platform.

The following constructors are available:

=over 4

=item B<new(OPTIONS)>

Creates a new B<AnyEvent::Filesys::Watcher::KQueue>.  The constructor may throw an
exception in case of an error!

B<OPTIONS> is a hash of named options:

=over 8

=item B<directories DIRECTORIES>

B<DIRECTORIES> is a reference to an array of directories to monitor. A single
directory can also be passed as a scalar.

This argument is required.

=item B<callback CALLBACK>

A code reference that is called, when a modification to the monitored
directories is deteced. The callback is passed a list of
L<AnyEvent::Filesys::Watcher::Events>.

This argument is required.

=item B<filter FILTER>

B<FILTER> should either be a regular expression or a code reference.  If this
is a regular expression, only (absolute) file names matching that regular
expressions can cause an event.

If B<FILTER> is a code reference, the subrouting receives the absolute file
name as an argument and should return a truthy value for all files that
should cause an event.

Optional. By default, all events are passed through.

=item B<skip_subdirectories BOOLEAN>

Skips subdirectories and anything in them while building a list of
files/dirs to watch. Optional.

=back

All other options are ignored.

=head1 METHODS

See the base class L<AnyEvent::Filesys::Watcher>. This module does not have
any additional public methods.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

The underlying L<IO::KQueue> module requires to keep an open file descriptor
on every file watched. Therefore, it is not suitable for monitoring directory
structures with a lot of files.

The soft limit on open file descriptors is usually 8192 on BSD systems.  This
backend will therefore issue a warning when you reach a certain number of
open file descriptors.  The warning threshold is 128 if L<BSD::Resource> is not
installed. With L<BSD::Resource> it is half of the maximum allowed number of
open file descriptors.
