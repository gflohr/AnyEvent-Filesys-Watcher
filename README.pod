=head1 AnyEvent-Filesys-Watcher - Watch file system for changes

This is a drop-in replacement for
LL<https://github.com/mvgrimes/AnyEvent-Filesys-Notify>
but with fewer dependencies.

See the manual page
LL<https://github.com/gflohr/AnyEvent-Filesys-Watcher/blob/main/lib/AnyEvent/Filesys/Watcher.pod>
for details.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Unless you are using MS-DOS, you should install a helper module that
provides the binding for the operating system's filesystem watch
functionality:

=head2 Linux

Install C<Linux::Inotify2>:

 $ cpanm Linux::Inotify2

=head2 Mac OS

Install a fork of C<Mac::FSEvents>:

 $ git clone https://github.com/skaji/Mac-FSEvents
 $ cd Mac-FSEvents
 $ perl Makefile.PL
 $ make
 $ make install

The current version 0.14 of C<Mac::FSEvents> available on CPAN does not
build on recent Mac OS versions.

=head2 BSD

Install C<IO::KQueue> and C<BSD::Resource>

 $ cpanm IO::KQueue BSD::Resource

This would also work for Mac OS but you have little reason to prefer
C<IO::KQueue> over C<Mac::FSEvents> unless you are a developer or just
curious.

=head1 AUTHOR

C<AnyEvent::Filesys::Notify> by Mark Grimes, L<mailto:mgrimes@cpan.org> and
